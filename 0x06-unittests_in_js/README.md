Unit Testing in JavaScript with Mocha, Chai, and Sinon
This project provides a hands-on introduction to unit testing in JavaScript using Mocha, Chai, and Sinon. You'll build your skills by creating a series of tests for various functionalities.

Learning Objectives:

Understand the concepts of unit testing and its benefits
Write test suites using Mocha as a test runner
Utilize Chai for making assertions in your tests
Leverage Sinon to create spies and stubs for mocking dependencies
Explore different testing scenarios, including basic functions, APIs, and asynchronous operations
Project Structure:

The project is organized into several folders, each focusing on a specific learning objective:

0x06-unittests_in_js: This is the main project directory containing the source code and test files.
8-api, 9-api, 10-api: These folders progressively build upon each other, creating a simple Node.js API with integration tests.
Tasks:

The project consists of ten mandatory tasks, each building upon the previous one. These tasks guide you through creating test suites for various functionalities:

Basic Test with Mocha and Node Assertion Library: Set up a basic test with Mocha and the assert library from Node.js.
Combining Descriptions: Organize your tests using describe and improve readability.
Basic Test using Chai Assertion Library: Explore Chai for a more descriptive assertion style.
Spies: Utilize Sinon to create spies and verify function calls.
Stubs: Learn how to stub functions for controlled testing behavior.
Hooks: Implement beforeEach and afterEach hooks for efficient test setup and teardown.
Async Tests with done: Handle asynchronous operations using the done callback in Mocha.
Skip: Skip failing tests temporarily while keeping track of them.
Basic Integration Testing: Create a basic Node.js API with a simple endpoint and write integration tests using Mocha and Chai.
Deep Equality & Post Integration Testing: Extend the API with additional functionalities and write tests for object comparisons and POST requests.
